To run web server:

loop:

agent
    .act(environment_view, actions) -> string        (action string, the agent must ensure it returns one of the valid actions specified)

environment
    .get_view(agent) -> environment_view, actions    (key/value pairs, list of valid actions_)
    .update(agent, action) -> None                   (nothing returned, the effects of the action are on the agents state which is stored in the environment and probably visible to it via the environment_view)
    .save()

environment_view
    .get('key') -> object                   (agents need to know what keys exist in their environments, analogous to the senses that animals evolve to understand their environment)
